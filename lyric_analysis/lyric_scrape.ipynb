In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain  And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D-train  We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight  Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane  Louise she's all right she's just near  She's delicate and seems like the mirror  But she just makes it all too concise and too clear  That Johanna's not here  The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face  Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.    Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously  He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously  And when bringing her name up  He speaks of a farewell kiss to me  He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all  Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall  Oh, how can I explain ?  It's so hard to get on  And these visions of Johanna they kept me up past the dawn.    Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial  Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while  But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues  You can tell by the way she smiles  See the primitive wallflower frieze  When the jelly-faced women all sneeze  Hear the one with the mustache say, &quot;Jeeze  I can't find my knees.&quot;  Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule  But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.    The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him  Saying, &quot;Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him.&quot;  But like Louise always says  &quot;Ya can't look at much, can ya man.&quot;    As she, herself prepares for him  And Madonna, she still has not showed  We see this empty cage now corrode  Where her cape of the stage once had flowed  The fiddler, he now steps to the road  He writes everything's been returned which was owed  On the back of the fish truck that loads  While my conscience explodes  The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain  And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain. \",\n",

I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are   Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars   You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies   One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes   Blood on your saddle.

It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart   You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart   Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped   What's good is bad what's bad is good you'll find out when you reach the top   You're on the bottom.I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind   I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed your eyes don't look    into mine   The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone faced while the    building burned   I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees while the    springtime turned   Slowly into autumn.      Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull   From the Grand Coulee Dam to Capitol   Idiot wind blowing every time you move you teeth   You're an idiot babe.   It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.      I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read   Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I was somebody else instead   Down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy   I followed you beneath the stars hounded by your memory   And all you raging glory.      I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free   I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me   You'll never know the hurt I suffered not the pain I raise above   And I'll never know the same about you your holiness or your kind of love   And it makes me feel so sorry.

       " 'Hurricane': [\"  Pistols shots ring out in the bar room night  Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall  She sees the bartender in a pool of blood  Cries out, &quot;My God, they killed them all!&quot;    Here comes the story of the Hurricane  The man the authorities came to blame  For something that he never done  Put him in a prison cell but one time he could-a been  The champion of the world.    Three bodies lying there does Patty see  And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously  &quot;I didn't do it&quot;, he says and he throws up his hands,  &quot;I was only robbing the register. I hope you understand.    &quot;I saw them leaving,&quot; he says and he stops,  &quot;One of us had better call up the cops.&quot;  And so Patty calls the cops  And they arrive on the scene  With their red lights flashing  In the hot New Jersey night.    Meanwhile far away in another part of town  Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around  Number one contender for the middleweight crown  Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down    When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road  Just like the time before and the time before that  In Patterson that's just the way things go  If you're black you might as well not show up on the street  'Less you wanna draw the heat.    Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops  Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around  He said, &quot;I saw two men running out. They looked like middleweights.  They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.&quot;    And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head  Cop said, &quot;Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead.&quot;  So they took him to the infirmary  And though this man could hardly see  They told him he could identify the guilty men.    Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in  They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs  The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye  Says, &quot;Why'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!&quot;    Here's the story of the Hurricane  The man the authorities came to blame  For something that he never done  Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been the champion of the world.    Four months later the ghettos are in flame  Rubin's in South America fighting for his name  While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game  And the cops are putting the screws to him looking for somebody to blame    &quot;Remember that murder that you happened in a bar?  Remember you said you saw the getaway car?  You think you'd like to play ball with the law?  Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?  Don't forget that you are white&quot;.    Arthur Dexter Bradley said, &quot;I'm really not sure.&quot;  The cop said, &quot;A boy like you could use a break.  We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello.  Now you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.    You'll be doing society a favor.  That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver.  We want to put his ass in stir.  We want to pin this triple murder on him.  He ain't no Gentleman Jim.&quot;    Rubin could take a man out with just one punch  But he never did like to talk about it all that much  &quot;It's my work,&quot; he'd say, &quot;and I do it for pay.  And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way    Up to some paradise.  Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice.  And ride a horse along a trail.&quot;  But then they took him to the jailhouse  Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.    All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance  The trial was a pig-circus. He never had a chance  The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums  To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum    And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger  No one doubted that he pulled the trigger  And though they could not produce the gun  The DA said he was the one who did the deed  And the all-white jury agreed.    Rubin Carter was falsely tried  The crime was murder 'one'. Guess who testified?  Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied  And the newspapers\\xe2\\x80\\x94they all went along for the ride    How can the life of such a man  Be in the palm of some fool's hand?  To see him obviously framed  Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed  To live in a land  Where justice is a game.    Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties  Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise  While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell  An innocent man in a living hell    Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane  But it won't be over 'til they clear his name  And give him back the time he's done  Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been  The champion of the world. \",\n",

I came to a high place of darkness and light   The dividing line ran through the center of town   I hitched up my pony to a post on the right   Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.      A man in the corner approached me for a match   I knew right away he was not ordinary   He said &quot;Are you looking for something easy to catch ?&quot;   I said &quot;I got no money&quot;. He said &quot;That ain't necessary&quot;.      We set out that night for the cold in the North   I gave him my blanket he gave me his word   I said &quot;Where are we going ?&quot; He said &quot;We'd be back by the fourth&quot;   I said &quot;That's the best new that I've ever heard&quot;.      I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold   I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace   As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold   I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.      How she told me that one day we meet up again   And things would be different the next time we wed   If I only could hang on and just be her friend   I still can't remember all the best things she said.      We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice   He said &quot;There's a body I'm trying to find   If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize&quot;   It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.      The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous   We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn   When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious   But I made up my mind that I had to go on.   I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty   There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had   When I saw that my partner was just being friendly   When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.       I picked up his body and I dragged him inside   Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover   I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied   Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.      She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise   Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed   I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes   I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.      She said &quot;Where ya been ?&quot; I said &quot;No place special ?&quot;   She said &quot;You look different&quot; I said &quot;Well I guess&quot;   She said &quot;You been gone&quot; I said &quot;That's only natural&quot;   She said &quot;You gonna stay ?&quot; I said &quot;If you want me to, Yeah &quot;.

She was married when we first met  Soon to be divorced  I helped her out of a jam I guess  But I used a little too much force  We drove that car as far as we could  Abandoned it out West  Split it up on a dark sad night  Both agreeing it was best  She turned around to look at me  As I was walking away  I heard her say over my shoulder  &quot;We'll meet again someday on the avenue&quot;  Tangled up in blue.    I had a job in the great north woods  Working as a cook for a spell  But I never did like it all that much  And one day the ax just fell  So I drifted down to New Orleans  Where I happened to be employed  Working for a while on a fishing boat  Right outside of Delacroix  But all the while I was alone   The past was close behind  I seen a lot of women  But she never escaped my mind and I just grew  Tangled up in blue.    She was working in a topless place  And I stopped in for a beer  I just kept looking at her side of her face  In the spotlight so clear  And later on as the crowd thinned out  I was just about to do the same  She was standing there in back of my chair  Said to me &quot;Don't I know your name?&quot;  I muttered something underneath my breath  She studied the lines on my face  I must admit I felt a little uneasy  When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe  Tangled up in blue.    She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe  &quot;I thought you'd never say hello&quot; she said  &quot;You look like the silent type&quot;  Then she opened up a book of poems  And handed it to me  Written by an Italian poet  From the fifteenth century  And every one of them words rang true  And glowed like burning coal  Pouring off of every page  Like it was written in my soul from me to you  Tangled up in blue    I lived with them on Montague Street  In a basement down the stairs  There was music in the caf\\xc3\\xa9 at night  And revolution in the air  Then he started into dealing with slaves  And something inside of him died  She had to sell everything she owned  And froze up inside  And when finally the bottom fell out   I became withdrawn  The only thing I knew how to do  Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew  Tangled up in blue.    So now I'm going back again  I got to get her somehow  All the people we used to know  They're an illusion to me now  Some are mathematicians  Some are carpenter's wives  Don't know how it all got started  I don't what they're doing with their lives  But me I'm still on the road  Heading for another joint  We always did feel the same  We just saw it from a different point of view  Tangled up in Blue. \",\n",

Ain't talking, just walking    Carrying a dead man's shield    Heart burning, still yearning    Walking with an ache in my heel       The suffering is unending    Every nook and cranny has its tears    I'm not playing, I'm not pretending    I'm not nursing any superfluous fears       Ain't talking, just walking    Walking ever since the other night.    Heart burning, still yearning    Walking until I'm clean out of sight.       As I walked out in the mystic garden    On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn    Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon    There's no one here, the gardener is gone       Ain't talking, just walking    Up the road, around the bend.

They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules  He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools  They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts  He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts  Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had. \",\n",

       " 'Lily, Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts': [\"  The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall  The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall  The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down  Anyone with any sense had already left town  He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts.    He moved across the mirrored room &quot;Set it up for everyone&quot; he said  Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads  Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin  &quot;Could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins ?&quot;  Then he moved into the corner face down like the Jack of Hearts.    Backstage the girls were playing five card stud by the stairs  Lily had two queens she was hoping for a third to match her pair  Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide  A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside  Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.    Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine  He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine  With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place  He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste  But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.    Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town  She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown  She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear  &quot;Sorry darling, that I'm late&quot;, but he didn't seem to hear  He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts.    &quot;I know I've seen that face somewhere&quot; Big Jim was thinking to himself  &quot;Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf&quot;  But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim  And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him  Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.    Lily was a princess she was fair-skinned and precious as a child  She did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled  She'd come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs  With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere  But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.  The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined  The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind  It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring  And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king  No nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.    Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife  She was tired of the attention tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife  She had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide  Was looking to do just one good deed before she died  She was gazing to the future riding on the Jack of Hearts.    Lily took her dress off and buried it away  &quot;Has your luck run out?&quot; she laughed at him.  &quot;Well I guess you must have known it would someday  Be careful not to touch the wall there's a brand new coat of paint  I'm glad to see you're still alive you're looking like a saint&quot;  Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts.    The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair  &quot;There's something funny going on&quot; he said &quot; I can just feel it in the air&quot;  He went to get the hanging judge but the hanging judge was drunk  As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk  There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.    No one knew the circumstance, but they say it happened pretty quick  The door to the dressing room burst open a Colt revolver clicked  And big Jim was standing there you couldn't say surprised  Rosemary right beside him studying her eyes  She was with big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts.    Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall  And cleaned out the bank safe it's said that they got off with quite a haul  In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground  For one more member who had business back in town  But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.    The next day was hanging day the sky was overcast and black  Big Jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back  And Rosemary on the gallows she didn't even blink  The hanging judge was sober he hadn't had a drink  The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts.  The cabaret was empty now a sign said. &quot;Closed for repair&quot;  Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair  She was thinking about her father who she very rarely saw  Thinking about Rosemary and thinking about the law  But most of all she was thinking about the Jack of Hearts. \",\n",

The light in this place is so bad   Makin' me sick in the head   All the laughter is just makin' me sad   The stars have turned cherry red.

I'll eat when I'm hungry   Drink when I'm dry   And live my life on the square   And even if the flesh falls off of my face   I know someone will be there to care.      It always meaned so much, even the softest touch.

I said, &quot;Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain&quot;.   He said, &quot;Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane&quot;.   He grabbed my arm, I said &quot;Ouch&quot;.   As I landed on the psychiatric couch   He said, &quot;Tell me about it&quot;.      Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast   It was all over by quarter past   I was down in the sewer with some little lover   When I peeked out from a manhole cover   Wondering who turned the lights on.      Well, I got up and walked around   And up and down the lonesome town   I stood a-wondering which way to go   I lit a cigarette on a parking meter   And walked on down the road   It was a normal day.      Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell   And leaned my head and I gave a yell   &quot;Give me a string bean I'm a hungry man&quot;   A shortgun fired and away I ran   I don't blame them too much though   They didn't know me.      Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand   I seen a man I said &quot;Howdy friend,   I guess there's just us two&quot;   He screamed a bit and away he flew   Thought it was a Communist.      Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave   &quot;Let's go and play Adam and Eve&quot;   I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'   When she said, &quot;Hey man, you crazy or sumpin'   You see what happened last time they started&quot;.   Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown   And there was nobody aroun'   I got into the driver's seat   And I drove down to 42nd Street   In my Cadillac   Good car to drive after a war.      Well, I remember seein' some ad   So I turned on my Conelrad   But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill   So the radio didn't work so well   Turned on my record player   It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singin'   &quot;Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa   Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah&quot;   .   I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue   I needed somebody to talk to   So I called up the operator of time   Just to hear a voice of some kind   &quot;When you hear the beep   It will be three o'clock&quot;   She said that for over an hour   And I hung up.      Well the doctor interrupted me just about then   Sayin' &quot;Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams   But mine was a little different you see   I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me   I didn't see you around&quot;.      Well, now time passed and now it seems   Everybody's having them dreams   Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else   Half of the people can be part right all of the time   Some of the people can be all right part of the time   But all of the people can't be all right all of the time   I think Abraham Lincoln said that   &quot;I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours&quot;   I said that. \",\n",

Well the Marshall now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp   As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath   Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square   I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.

I can still see the day that you came to me on the pinked desert   In your busted down Ford and your platform heels   I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet   Ah, but you were right it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.      Well we drove that car all night 'til we got into San Anton'   And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft   Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back   I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blow off.      Well we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies    Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul   But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times    when I was your only man   And she don't want to remind me.

Brownsville girl you're my honey love.Well we crossed the panthandle and then we headed towards Amarillo   We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wrecking lot outside of    town about a mile   Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us   come rolling up in a trail of dust   She said &quot;Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while&quot;.      Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming   a ride back to where she started   But she changed the subject every time money came up   She said &quot;Welcome to the land of the living dead&quot;. You could tell she was    so broken-hearted   She said &quot;Even the swap meets around here are pretty corrupt&quot;.      &quot;How far are you all going ?&quot; Ruby asked us with a sigh   &quot;We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn   Until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies&quot;   Ruby just smiled and said. &quot;Ah you know some babies never learn&quot;.      Something about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head   But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play   All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved   And a lot of them seemed to be looking my way.

Well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour   I was crossing the street when shots rang out   I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran   We got him cornered in the churchyard ? I heard somebody shout.      Well you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said:   &quot;A man with no alibi&quot;   You went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you   Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears   It was the best acting I saw anybody do.      Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trepass but sometimes    you just find yourself over the line   Oh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now   You now I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better   If you were just here by my side to show me how.   Well I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck   Yeh but you know it's not the one I had in mind   He's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about   But I'll se him in anything so I'll stand in line.

There was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice   I don't remember who I was or where I was bound   All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot    in the back   Seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down.

I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,  And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.    This is looking like a contest,  Of who can act like they care less,  But I liked it better when you were on my side.  The battle's in your hands now,  But I would lay my armor down  If you said you'd rather love than fight.  So many things that you wish I knew,  But the story of us might be ending soon.     [Chorus:]   Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,  And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?

Cinderella, she seems so easy  &quot;It takes one to know one,&quot; she smiles  And puts her hands in her back pockets  Bette Davis style  And in comes Romeo, he's moaning,  &quot;You belong to Me I Believe.&quot;  And someone says, &quot;You're in the wrong place, my friend  You'd better leave.&quot;  And the only sound that's left  After the ambulances go  Is Cinderella sweeping up  On Desolation Row.    Now the moon is almost hidden  The stars are beginning to hide  The fortune-telling lady  Has even taken all her things inside  All except for Cain and Abel  And the hunchback of Notre Dame  Everybody is making love  Or else expecting rain  And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing  He's getting ready for the show  He's going to the carnival tonight  On Desolation Row.    Ophelia, she's 'neath the window  For her I feel so afraid  On her twenty-second birthday  She already is an old maid  To her, death is quite romantic  She wears an iron vest  Her profession's her religion  Her sin is her lifelessness  And though her eyes are fixed upon  Noah's great rainbow  She spends her time peeking  Into Desolation Row.    Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood  With his memories in a trunk  Passed this way an hour ago  With his friend, a jealous monk  NOW, he looked so immaculately frightful  As he bummed a cigarette  Then he went off sniffing drainpipes  And reciting the alphabet  You would not think to look at him  But he was famous long ago  For playing the electric violin  On Desolation Row.

Across the street they've nailed the curtains  They're getting ready for the feast  The Phantom of the Opera  In a perfect image of a priest  They are spoon-feeding Casanova  To get him to feel more assured  Then they'll kill him with self-confidence  After poisoning him with words  And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls  &quot;Get outta here if you don't know&quot;  Casanova is just being punished for going  To Desolation Row.    At midnight all the agents  And the superhuman crew  Come out and round up everyone  That knows more than they do  Then they bring them to the factory  Where the heart-attack machine  Is strapped across their shoulders  And then the kerosene  Is brought down from the castles  By insurance men who go  Check to see that nobody is escaping  To Desolation Row.    Praise be to Nero's Neptune  The Titanic sails at dawn  Everybody's shouting  &quot;Which side are you on?&quot;  And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot  Fighting in the captain's tower  While calypso singers laugh at them  And fishermen hold flowers  Between the windows of the sea  Where lovely mermaids flow  And nobody has to think too much  About Desolation Row.

Oh the history books tell it   They tell it so well   The cavalries charged   The Indians fell   The cavalries charged   The Indians died   Oh the country was young   With God on its side.      The Spanish-American   War had its day   And the Civil War too   Was soon laid away   And the names of the heroes   I's made to memorize   With guns on their hands   And God on their side.      The First World War, boys   It came and it went   The reason for fighting   I never did get   But I learned to accept it   Accept it with pride   For you don't count the dead   When God's on your side.      When the Second World War   Came to an end   We forgave the Germans   And then we were friends   Though they murdered six million   In the ovens they fried   The Germans now too   Have God on their side.      I've learned to hate Russians   All through my whole life   If another war comes   It's them we must fight   To hate them and fear them   To run and to hide   And accept it all bravely   With God on my side.      But now we got weapons   Of the chemical dust   If fire them we're forced to   Then fire them we must   One push of the button   And a shot the world wide   And you never ask questions   When God's on your side.      In a many dark hour   I've been thinkin' about this   That Jesus Christ   Was betrayed by a kiss   But I can't think for you   You'll have to decide   Whether Judas Iscariot   Had God on his side.      So now as I'm leavin'   I'm weary as Hell   The confusion I'm feelin'   Ain't no tongue can tell   The words fill my head   And fall to the floor   If God's on our side   He'll stop the next war. \",\n",

Ah me I busted out   Don't even ask me how   I went to get some help   I walked by a Guernsey cow   Who directed me down   To the Bowery slums   Where people carried signs around   Saying, &quot;Ban the bums&quot;   I jumped right into line   Sayin' &quot;I hope that I'm not late&quot;   When I realized I hadn't eaten   For five days straight.      I went into a restaurant   Lookin' for the cook   I told him I was the editor   Of a famous etiquette book   The waitress he was handsome   He wore a powder blue cape   I ordered some suzette, I said   &quot;Could you please make that crepe&quot;   Just then the whole kitchen exploded   From boillin' fat   Food was flying anywhere   And I left without my had.      Now, I didn't mean to be nosy   But I went into a bank   To get some bail for Arab   And all the boys back in the tank   They asked me for some collateral   And I pulled down my pants   They threw me in the alley   When up comes this girl from France   Who invited me to her house   I went, but she had a friend   Who knocked me out   And robbed my boots   And I was on the street again.      Well, I rapped upon a house   With the US flag upon display   I said, &quot;Could you help me out   I got some friends down the way   &quot; The man says, &quot;Get out of here   I'll tear you limp from limb&quot;   I said, &quot;You know they refused Jesus, too&quot;   He said, &quot;You're not Him   Get out of here before I break your bones   I ain't your pop&quot;   I decided to have him arrested   And I went lookin for a cop.      I ran right outside   And I hopped inside a cab   I went out the other door   This Englishman said, &quot;Fab&quot;   As he saw me leap a hot dog stand   And a chariot that stood   Parked across from a building   Advertising brotherhood   I ran right through the front door   Like a hobo sailor does   But it was just a funeral parlor   And the man asked me who I was.       I repeated that my friends   Where all in jail, with a sigh   He gave me his card   He said, &quot;Call me if they die&quot;   I shook his hand and said goodbye   Ran out to the street   When a bowling ball came down the road   And knocked me off my feet   A pay phone was ringing   It just about blew my mind   When I picked it up and said hello   This foot came through the line.      Well, by this time I was feed up   At tryin'g to make a stab   At bringin' back any help   For my friends and captain Arab   I decided to flip a coin   Like either heads or tails   Would let me know if I should go   Back to the ship or back to jail   So I hooked my sailor suit   And I got a coin to flip   It came up tails   It rhymed with sails   So I made it back to the ship.      Well, I got back and took   The parkin' ticket off the mast   I was ripping it to shreds   When this coastguard boat went past   They asked me my name   And I said, &quot;Captain Kidd&quot;   They believed me but   They wanted to know   What exactly that I did   I said for the Pope of Eruke   I was employed   They let me go right away   They were very paranoid.      Well, the last I heard of Arab   He was stuck on a whale   That was married to the deputy   Sheriff of the jail   But the funniest thing was   When I was leavin' the bay   I saw three ships a-sailin'   There were all heading my way   I asked the captain what his name was   And how come he didn't drive a truck   He said his name was Columbus   I just said, &quot;Good luck&quot;. \",\n",

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,  I watched you laughing from the passenger side.  Realized I loved you in the fall.    And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind  You gave me all your love and all I gave you was &quot;Goodbye&quot;.

Maybe this is wishful thinking,  Probably mindless dreaming,  But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.    I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.  So if the chain is on your door I understand.    But this is me swallowing my pride  Standing in front of you saying, &quot;I'm sorry for that night.&quot;  And I go back to December...

Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,  Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery,  Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me  About the madness of becomin' what one was never meant to be.

Ain't seen her since January,  She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.

In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched   With faces hidden as the walls were tightening   As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain   Dissolved into the bells of the lightning   Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake   Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked   Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail   The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder   That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze   Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder   Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind   Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind   An' the poet an the painter far behind his rightful time   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales   For the disrobed faceless forms of no position   Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts   All down in taken-for granted situations   Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute   For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute   For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Even though a clouds's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed   An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting   Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones   Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting   Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail   For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale   An' for each unharmfull, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught   Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended   As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look   Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended   Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed   For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse   An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. \",\n",

I moved in closer got up on my toes   Two men in front of me were coming to blows   A man was saying something about children when they're young   Being sacrificed that's why lullabies are being sung.

Pray for people he said you could feel it in the crowd   My thoughts began to wander but his voice was ringing loud   It will destroy you family your happy home is gone   No one can protect you from it once you turn it on.      It will lead you in to some strange pursuits   Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits   Scramble up your head and drag your brain about   Sometimes you got to do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.      It's all been designed he said to make you loose your mind   And when you go back to find it there's nothing there to find   Every time you look at it your situations worse   If you feel it grabbing out for you send for the nurse.      The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man   There was pushing there was showing and everybody ran   The TV crew was there to film it they jumped right over me   Later on that evening I watched it on TV. \",\n",

Well, my heart's in the highlands, wherever I roam   That's where I'll be when I get called home   The wind it whispers to the buck-eyed trees of rhyme   Well, my heart's in the highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.      I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound   Someone's always yellin', &quot;Turn him down&quot;   Feel like I'm driftin', driftin' from scene to scene   I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.      Insanity is smashin' up against my soul   You could say I was on anything but a roll   If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top   What would I do with it anyway, maybe take it to the pawn shop.      My heart's in the highlands at the break of dawn   By the beautiful lake of the black swan   Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low   Well, my heart's in the highlands, only place left to go.      I'm in Boston town, in some restaurant   I got no idea what I want   Or maybe I do but, I'm just really not sure   Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.      Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around   She studies me closely as I sit down   She got a pretty face, with long white shiny legs   I said, &quot;Tell me what I want,&quot; she say, &quot;You probably want hard boiled eggs.&quot;      I say, &quot;That's right, bring me some.&quot;   She says, &quot;We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come.&quot;   Then she says, &quot;I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me.&quot;   I said, &quot;I would if I could but I don't do sketches from memory.&quot;      Well, she then, she says, &quot;I'm right here in front of you, or   haven't you looked?&quot;   I say, &quot;All right, I know but I don't have my drawing book.&quot;   She gives me a napkin, she say, &quot;You can do it on that.&quot;   I say, &quot;Yes I could but I don't know where my pencil is at.&quot;      She pulls one out from behind her ear   She says, &quot;All right now go ahead, draw me, I'm stayin' right here.&quot;   I make a few lines and I show it for her to see   Well, she takes her napkin and throws it back and says, &quot;That   don't look a thing like me.&quot;      I said, &quot;Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does.&quot;   She say, &quot;You must be jokin',&quot; I say, &quot;I wish I was.&quot;   Then she says, &quot;You don't read women authors do ya?&quot; at least   that's what I think I hear her say   Well, I said, &quot;How would you know and what would it matter anyway?&quot;      Well she says, &quot;You just don't seem like you do.&quot; I said,   &quot;You're way wrong.&quot;   She says &quot;Which ones have you read then?&quot; I say, &quot;I've read   Erica Jong.&quot;   She goes away for a minute and I slide out, out of my chair   I step outside back to the busy street but nobody is goin' anywhere.      Well, my heart's in the highlands with the horses and hounds   Way up in the border country far from the towns   With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow   My heart's in the highlands, I can't see any other way to go.      Every day is the same thing, out the door   Feel further away than ever before   Some things in life it just gets too late to learn   Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must have made a few bad turns.      I see people in the park forgettin' their troubles and woes   They're drinkin' and dancin', wearin' bright colored clothes   All the young men, with the young women lookin' so good   Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute, if I could.      I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog   Talkin' to myself in a monologue   I think what I need might be a full length leather coat   Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.      The sun is beginnin' to shine on me   But it's not like the sun that used to be   The party's over and there's less and less to say   I got new eyes, everything looks far away.      Well, my heart's in the highlands at the break of day   Over the hills and far away   There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow   Well, I'm already there in my mind, and that's good enough for now. \",\n",

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,  And you've still got it in your drawer even now.    Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.  We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.  Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,  And I can picture it after all these days.    And I know it's long gone,  And that magic's not here no more,  And I might be okay,  But I'm not fine at all.    'Cause there we are again on that little town street.  You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.  Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.    Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.  You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed  And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team  You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.    And I know it's long gone  And there was nothing else I could do  And I forget about you long enough  To forget why I needed to...    'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.  We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.    Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,  But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.  Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.    Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.  So casually cruel in the name of being honest.  I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.    Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it  I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it  After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone    But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah    'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so  Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well    Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all  Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all  It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well \",\n",
